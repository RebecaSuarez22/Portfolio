### ðŸ”¬ Diabetes Prediction with Ensemble Learning and Transfer Learning 
ðŸ”—[View project](https://github.com/RebecaSuarez22/RebecaSuarez22/tree/main/machine_learning/diabetes_prediction_transfer_learning)  

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras Tuner

**Description:**  
Built predictive models to detect diabetes based on clinical variables using ensemble learning techniques and PCA. Compared performance using original features vs. principal components. Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network to improve final model accuracy.

**Highlights:**
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- Trained and compared ensemble models including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Used transfer learning to fine-tune a neural network on the diabetes dataset.
- Evaluated results with metrics and visualizations.
