## 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning


### 🔬 Diabetes Prediction with Ensemble Learning and Transfer Learning 
🔗[View project](./machine_learning/diabetes_prediction_transfer_learning)  

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras Tuner

**Description:**  
Built predictive models to detect diabetes based on clinical variables using ensemble learning techniques and PCA. Compared performance using original features vs. principal components. Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network to improve final model accuracy.

**Highlights:**
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- Trained and compared ensemble models including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Used transfer learning to fine-tune a neural network on the diabetes dataset.
- Evaluated results with metrics and visualizations.
