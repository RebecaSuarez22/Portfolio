## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Deep Learning


### ðŸ”¬ Diabetes Prediction with Ensemble Learning and Transfer Learning 
ðŸ”—[View project](./machine_learning/diabetes_prediction_transfer_learning)  

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras Tuner

**Description:**  
Built predictive models to detect diabetes based on clinical variables using ensemble learning techniques and PCA. Compared performance using original features vs. principal components. Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network to improve final model accuracy.

**Highlights:**
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- Trained and compared ensemble models including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Used transfer learning to fine-tune a neural network on the diabetes dataset.
- Evaluated results with metrics and visualizations.

### ðŸ‘Ÿ Fashion MNIST Classification with Supervised Learning
ðŸ”—[View project](./machine_learning/fashion_mnist_supervised_learning)  

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy  



**Description:**  
Evaluated and compared multiple supervised learning algorithms on the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify grayscale images of clothing. Explored model performance using metrics and visualizations, and structured the entire pipeline for reproducibility.

**Highlights:**
- Preprocessed and visualized a subset of the Fashion MNIST dataset (5 classes).
- Compared classifiers including Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- Assessed performance using cross-validation and confusion matrices.
- Structured the training process with reusable components and performance plots.

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis & EDA

### ðŸ§© Sleep Health Statistical Study

**Tools:** R, ggplot2, infer

**Description:**  
Performed descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to explore associations between sleep patterns and variables like gender, stress level, and BMI.

**Highlights:**
- Tested four research hypotheses using t-tests and proportions.
- Built clear visual summaries with ggplot2.
