## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Deep Learning


### ðŸ”¬ Diabetes Prediction with Ensemble Learning and Transfer Learning 
ðŸ”—[View project](./machine_learning/diabetes_prediction_transfer_learning)  

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras Tuner

**Description:**  
Built predictive models to detect diabetes based on clinical variables using ensemble learning techniques and PCA. Compared performance using original features vs. principal components. Applied transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network to improve final model accuracy.

**Highlights:**
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- Trained and compared ensemble models including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Used transfer learning to fine-tune a neural network on the diabetes dataset.
- Evaluated results with metrics and visualizations.

### ðŸ‘Ÿ Fashion MNIST Classification with Supervised Learning  
ðŸ”—[View project](./machine_learning/fashion_mnist_supervised_learning)    

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy  



**Description:**  
Evaluated and compared multiple supervised learning algorithms on the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify grayscale images of clothing. Explored model performance using metrics and visualizations, and structured the entire pipeline for reproducibility.

**Highlights:**
- Preprocessed and visualized a subset of the Fashion MNIST dataset (5 classes).
- Compared classifiers including Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- Assessed performance using cross-validation and confusion matrices.
- Structured the training process with reusable components and performance plots.

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis & EDA

### ðŸ›Œ Sleep Health & Lifestyle - Exploratory Study
ðŸ”— [View project](./statistical_analysis/sleep_health_statistical_study)

**Tools:** R, R Markdown, tidyverse, ggplot2, infer

**Description:**  
Performed a statistical analysis of sleep habits and lifestyle factors to explore relationships between variables such as BMI, sleep duration, smoking, and heart disease. Included descriptive and inferential techniques with hypothesis testing and visualizations.

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and prepared sleep health dataset with multiple lifestyle indicators.
- Performed t-tests, ANOVA and chi-square tests to evaluate hypotheses.
- Built confidence intervals and visualized distributions with ggplot2.
- Report fully rendered in R Markdown and exported to HTML.

###  ðŸ“‰ Sleep Health - Hypothesis Testing in R
ðŸ”— [View project](./statistical_analysis/sleep_hypothesis_testing)

**Tools:** R, ggplot2, base stats

**Description:**  
Focused statistical study on sleep duration, stress, gender, and BMI. Tested four hypotheses using t-tests, proportions test, and chi-square to understand the relationships between lifestyle and sleep disorders.

**Highlights:**
- Evaluated average sleep duration vs. recommended levels.
- Compared sleep quality between genders.
- Assessed the impact of stress on sleep disorders.
- Explored association between BMI and disorder type.
