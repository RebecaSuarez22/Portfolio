# 🔬 Diabetes Prediction with Transfer Learning and Ensemble Methods

This project focuses on predicting diabetes based on clinical data using both traditional machine learning models and deep learning techniques, including transfer learning with neural networks.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Predict diabetes diagnosis from structured patient data
- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) to improve model performance
- Compare ensemble models and deep learning techniques
- Explore transfer learning as a tool to enhance neural network performance

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras Tuner
- **Techniques:** PCA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Transfer Learning
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Summary

The project starts with data exploration and cleaning, followed by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. Several models are then trained and compared, including:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- A Neural Network built from scratch
- A Transfer Learning model using a pre-trained base

Performance is evaluated using metrics and visualization tools to understand model effectiveness.
