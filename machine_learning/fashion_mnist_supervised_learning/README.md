# 👟 Fashion MNIST - Supervised Models Benchmark

This project explores the application of various supervised learning algorithms on the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify different categories of clothing images.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Benchmark classical supervised models for image classification
- Preprocess grayscale image data and prepare it for model training
- Evaluate and compare accuracy and performance across models
- Visualize predictions and misclassifications

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Languages:** Python  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Models Compared:**  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
**Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 📊 Summary

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories. After loading and preprocessing the data, multiple supervised algorithms are trained and tested. Key comparisons are made to determine which model best balances accuracy and interpretability. Confusion matrices and classification reports provide insight into each model's strengths and weaknesses.
