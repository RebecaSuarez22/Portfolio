# 🏠 Rental Price Prediction in Barcelona

This project explores rental pricing in the city of Barcelona by applying regression techniques to predict both the numerical value of rent and whether it exceeds a certain threshold. The analysis includes exploratory data work, model diagnostics, and performance evaluation.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore and visualize rental price data for the city of Barcelona.
- Build a multiple linear regression model to predict rental price.
- Apply logistic regression to classify high vs. low rental prices.
- Evaluate and interpret models through residuals and metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** ggplot2, caret, dplyr, stats  
- **Techniques:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, EDA, Model Diagnostics

## 📊 Summary

We analyze property listings in Barcelona, cleaning and visualizing the data before applying two modeling approaches:

- **Linear regression** to predict actual rental prices.
- **Logistic regression** to classify whether a rent is above or below a given threshold.

Each model includes assumption checks, performance metrics (R², RMSE, AIC), and interpretation of coefficients.
