# 💤 Sleep Health and Lifestyle - Statistical Study

This project applies descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the relationship between sleep health and lifestyle factors such as BMI, smoking, stress, and chronic diseases.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore correlations between lifestyle indicators and sleep patterns
- Perform hypothesis testing on selected variables
- Visualize key distributions and relationships
- Present results in a reproducible R Markdown report

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Language:** R  
- **Environment:** RStudio + R Markdown  
- **Libraries:** tidyverse, ggplot2, infer, dplyr  
- **Methods:** t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests, confidence intervals, EDA

## 📊 Summary

We analyze a dataset containing information on sleep duration, BMI, exercise, smoking, and more. The project includes:

- Data cleaning and recoding of categorical variables
- Exploratory analysis using bar plots, boxplots, and histograms
- Statistical testing to validate or reject hypotheses
- Interpretation of confidence intervals and test results
